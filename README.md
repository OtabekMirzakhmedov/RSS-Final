## Scripts

#### `npm run dev`

Description: Run the project using the development server.

#### `npm run build`

Description: Build the project for production transpiling TypeScript code and generating a production-ready build of the application in a single command.

#### `npm run lint`

Description: Run ESLint to check for code quality and formatting issues.

#### `npm run lint:fix`

Description: Run ESLint on the entire project directory and its subdirectories, targeting files with .ts and .tsx extensions and attempt to automatically fix any fixable issues found in the code.

#### `npm run format`

Description: Use Prettier to apply the necessary formatting changes directly to the files, modifying them in place.

#### `npm run ci:format`

Description: Use Prettier to check the formatting of all TypeScript and TypeScript JSX files within the src directory without actually modifying them. It enables the verification of code formatting before code gets merged, built, or deployed.

#### `npm run preview`

Description: Launch a development server to serve the Vite project and allows developers to preview the application in a local web browser.
**Note** You need to use `npm run build` before this script. Preview will always preview the latest build, and will not update automatically when code changes.

#### `npm run test`

Description: Execute the "vitest" tool for running tests in the project.

#### `npm run prepare`

Description: Initialize the "husky" package, configuring and setting up Git hooks according to the project's defined configuration, ensuring that the defined hooks are in place and ready to be used during development.

2. Navigate to the project's directory:
   cd your-repository

3. Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

- Using npm:
  npm install

4. Run the project locally:

- Using npm:
  npm run dev

## Project Structure

The project's directory structure is organized in the following way:

- **src/**: This folder contains the source code for the project.

  - **components/**: Stores all reusable React components.
  - **pages/**: Houses the main application pages and associated components.
  - **utils/**: Contains utility functions, helpers, and constants used across the application.
  - **styles/**: Holds global style files, SCSS or styled components, and theme-related configurations.
  - **api/**: Contains API-related configurations, service wrappers, and constants for making network requests.
  - **features/**: Organizes application features into separate sub-folders (e.g., authentication, user profile).

- **public/**: Contains the public assets, such as favicon, images, and other static files served by the application.

- **tests/**: Stores test files and configurations for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

- **.github/**: Houses any GitHub-specific templates, workflows, and configurations for GitHub Actions.

- **dist/**: The build output from Vite when the project is compiled and bundled for production deployment.

## Scripts

#### `npm run dev`

Description: Run the project using the development server.

#### `npm run build`

Description: Build the project for production transpiling TypeScript code and generating a production-ready build of the application in a single command.

#### `npm run lint`

Description: Run ESLint to check for code quality and formatting issues.

#### `npm run lint:fix`

Description: Run ESLint on the entire project directory and its subdirectories, targeting files with .ts and .tsx extensions and attempt to automatically fix any fixable issues found in the code.

#### `npm run format`

Description: Use Prettier to apply the necessary formatting changes directly to the files, modifying them in place.

#### `npm run ci:format`

Description: Use Prettier to check the formatting of all TypeScript and TypeScript JSX files within the src directory without actually modifying them. It enables the verification of code formatting before code gets merged, built, or deployed.

#### `npm run preview`

Description: Launch a development server to serve the Vite project and allows developers to preview the application in a local web browser.

#### `npm run test`

Description: Execute the "vitest" tool for running tests in the project.

#### `npm run prepare`

Description: Initialize the "husky" package, configuring and setting up Git hooks according to the project's defined configuration, ensuring that the defined hooks are in place and ready to be used during development.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
};
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
